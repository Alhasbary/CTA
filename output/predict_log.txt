Retrieving the CTA reference dataset ...
Compound-target pairs:
    Number of bioactivity records    = 809990
    Number of unique uniprot targets = 2858
    Number of unique compounds       = 522922

Compound statistics in the targets:
min =  1 	 median =  39.0 	 mean =  283.41147655703287 	 max =  7878

Start processing the ['QueryList1', 'QueryList2'] Query sets:

==================
Data set: QueryList1
==================

SMILES strings before preprocessing:
Number of compounds: 10
Number of unique compounds: 10

SMILES strings after preprocessing:
Number of compounds: 10
Number of unique compounds: 10
 preprocessing completed in 3.24 seconds.

Perform chemical similarity searches. 
    The cleaned SMILES strings for each compound are converted into 2048-bit ecfp fingerprints 
    with a radius of 2.

Start chemical similarity searches for 10 smiles

Similarity search completed in 39.49 seconds.

Retrieve potential targets for each SMILES string.


Results:
	Identified 2855 potential targets based on the mean similarity scores of the top k reference compounds for 10 SMILES strings.
	Additional details are stored in output\QueryList1_potential_targets_based_on_ecfp_with_k_value_of_{k}.csv
Retrieving the potential targets took 73.7912 seconds.
